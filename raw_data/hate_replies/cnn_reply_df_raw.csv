Then the Republicans fighting against that is them disarming their constituents.<br><br>Two it&#39;s not just yourself that you defend with the vaccine. If we had high vaccination rates we would effectively be done with the pandemic. If the virus has nowhere to go to make a lot more virus it dies out. If everyone was vaccinated then the virus would lose steam.

UgxWJAi-OAIZmlNUJ7d4AaABAg.9YkCx9b9HIn9Yqb6PhrOjz,"@Baztec Baztec even if that was your assumption, don’t you think it’s unethical to require medical procedures as if they’re one size fits all? I’d also like to inform you that it’s nearly impossible to get a medical exemption from vaccines because doctors who write them get targeted by medical licensing boards, and also because even when a doctor will write them it doesn’t mean the state health department will accept them. I know a child who nearly died from vaccines (clinically diagnosed as being caused by vaccines by 3 different specialists at prestigious medical institutions) who was banned from attending school in a state that only has medical exemptions as an option. His access to a free public education was denied because he couldn’t physically continue the vaccine series. The state didn’t care that vaccines were a threat to his life and decided that he was a threat to the other vaccinated kids. He shouldn’t have even needed to apply for any exemption. No one should need to jump through bureaucratic hoops to make personal medical decisions. A simple NO should suffice. Vaccines should be opt-in rather than opt-out. Nothing in life is one size fits all. Not even water. Don’t believe me? Try brushing your teeth with Mexican tap water and tell me how you feel a few days later.",0

No one has any right to be free from communicable illnesses. Nature doesn’t work that way and neither do vaccines. And I also don’t believe in sacrificing anyone at the altar of $¢I£N¢£. It’s not just a few people who are harmed or killed by vaccines, no matter what they try to tell you. Medical decisions should always be personal decisions, not done by coercion or threats of penalties or by force. Immune systems are for personal use only. No one owes anyone else a false sense of protection.",0

UgzD9y29iJM5mH29c5p4AaABAg.9Yk1nnuoUPp9YmPbs3-Y-v,"@Baztec Baztec I am not a doctor or a practicing physician, just a fervent man who has done medical research for a little over 42 years. While doing research after being told by the VA in 2008 due to Agent Orange from Vietnam, they removed the upper lobe of my right lung, they told me that I had six to eight months to live due to a failing heart and plugged arteries. I had all of the other diseases associated with the chemical. While researching how to survive my appointment with death, a book arrived in the mail it was the 2008 Bottom Line yearly health book, in the book was a four-page article titled  &quot; NO MORE HEART ATTACKS OR STROKES, HOW NITRIC OXIDE CAN PREVENT--EVEN REVERSE HEART DISEASE,&quot; by Dr. Louis Ignarrio, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1998 for his discovery of nitric oxide, and how to make more of it in humans, especially those populations that are older. Nitric Oxide is present in our bodies at a younger age, that is why young people do not suffer strokes or heart attacks except in rare circumstances. Nitric Oxide diminishes greatly as we age, and brings on the aging process. I just wished that I would have discovered it at the age of 40 when nitric oxide starts to diminish, in people exposed to Agent orange this depletion process starts at a younger age, usually at exposure. Dr. Ignarrio is one of three researchers in the development, he used L-Arginine, and L-Citrulline to accomplish this process, these two amino acids are found in the food we eat sometimes daily. I did not write the information down, I had some other errands to do and stopped by the health food store and purchased what I believed were the right two amino acids to complete the formula to create the gas. I got one of them right, I picked up the L-Arginine and L-Carnitine and started taking the combo at night, it seemed that I had increased energy and did not wish to go to sleep, and stayed up reading and writing to others. In less than two months I started to get better, I stopped taking the blood pressure medicine as it was not doing a thing for me. At about three months&#39; time, my blood pressure improved to the point where I knew i was going to get better, I was no longer concerned about my three to four months of prognosticated life span that the VA gave me. The VA then sent me to a second evaluating physician, and they said I was no longer 100% disabled, my arteries, and my brachial arteries at the ankles and my toes were no longer turning blue. O found that the L-Carnitine worked better than the L-Citrulline, especially for the lungs. At 74 years, I have the heart of a teenager acirrding to bloodwork and stress tests, i feel 35 years of age.  i have worked as a substitute teacher pretty much everyday while being exposed to sick teachers and students committning all kinds of attrocities on me by sneezing, coughing, throwing up on me, along with the occasional disgruntled student that will spit on me. When covid came about, i woindered if Nitric ocide would prevent Covid 19, I upped my dose from 500 to 1000 mg in themorning, and while being exposed to several who have  had the virus, along with all of the markers I have that i should have gotten Covis 19, i have not contracted the virus. In my research, i came across a lot of information about Nitric oxide and Civid. Nitric Oxide prevents Covid 2, which is a precurser to being able to get Covid 19. I found the most successful hospitals treating COVID 19 patients were giving the patients Nitric Oxide, instead of having to use a ventilator. I just use it in the capsule form, as did Dr. Ignarrio when he first discovered and published his findings. I owe my life to him! I also found the medicial research for its effectiveness against Covid. There are many articles in medical journals, which  Dr. Fauci should have found after 50,000 deaths one would think, since by that time he knew tyhat it was a Covid, or SARRS virus, he either knew or ignored the previous medical research or wanted to become America&#39;s hero in the hearts and minds of the majority of Americans. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC544093/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC544093/</a>   There are many articles on the subject.",0

Individuals also cannot use their rights in a way that harms the common good, like inciting a panic by yelling &#39;&#39;fire!&#39;&#39; in a crowded place.<br><br>When Jesus taught people to love their neighbors as themselves (Mark 12:30-31) and treat others as they would be treated (Matthew 7:12), he was teaching people to seek the Common Good.<br><br>When Paul said, “Do not seek your own personal interests alone, but also the interests of others,” he was teaching the Common Good (Philippians 2:4).<br><br>When John said, “Since God loved us so much, we also ought to love one another,” he was teaching the Common Good (1 John 4:11).<br><br>When Jesus said, “Whatever you do for the least of these, you do for me,” he was inviting us to seek the Common Good (Matthew 25:40).<br><br>When Jesus said, “You cannot serve both God and money,” he was teaching the common good (Matthew 6:24).<br><br>The Common Good teaches us to seek what’s best for everyone. Vaccines &amp; masks are what&#39;s best for everyone. It&#39;s charlatans that preach politics before God. It&#39;s charlatans that treat masks and vaccines as fire then shout &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded place when there is no fire. It&#39;s charlatans that puts full donation plates before their congregations health. When are these Christians going to start following Christ&#39;s Golden Rule?",0

I do not know enough about the situation in the former Yugoslavia and will read more into it, as it all seems very interesting, but the deductions that nato is not a defensive alliance, Russia was ignored, and this was a sort of war in Europe seem quite evident to me.

UgyuxE7uG53aGEget-J4AaABAg.9_3f6lzoVN69_Ay27x04fA,"@Andre Wagner Over a million things can go wrong in a plane, and everyone working with that plane has a job to do that keeps that plane in the air. What I’m trying to say is that I don’t think that the pilots purposefully crashed the plane as there was an attempt to save the aircraft. But, whether it be pilot error or a mechanical failure, the plane went into a dive and the pilots weren’t able to prevent the crash by that point. <br>I doubt it was a hijacking or some kind of attack, since security on planes has been upgraded (surprisingly, the many many hijackings before 9/11 were not enough to make changes) and the plane didn’t crash in a city so it would have the biggest impact. <br>Also, the plane should have been on autopilot. There have been crashes caused by accidentally disengaging the autopilot’s altitude, but it’s a gradual descent, not a nosedive. <br>But, like in any good discussion, I should admit that I’m biased. I’m familiar with planes, but I’m no pilot, so I don’t know what kind of error could cause a nosedive like this. So that’s another reason why I lean more to a mechanical problem because I do know some mechanical problems that could cause something like this.",0
UgyuxE7uG53aGEget-J4AaABAg.9_3f6lzoVN69_AzKRjIRh0,"@ki wi I agree, I heard from another video with a simulation that from the time the plane entered the nosedive to the time of the impact, there was a three minute window to call for help. It’s still small but possible to get something through. But, I doubt that calling for help would have done much for the crew. If they couldn’t keep the plane leveled out, then they were as good as dead. And they were descending at a rate somewhere around 8000 feet per minute, I believe. It could be that due to the dire situation, the pilots forgot to call for help.",0
UgyuxE7uG53aGEget-J4AaABAg.9_3f6lzoVN69_B25hqChUN,@Regina DuLac the plane managed to get out of the dive. There are 2 pilots. You do the math. It&#39;s highly suspicious that there was no call for help that is all. the pilots first instinct is to call for help. If they forgot then their not good pilots and I wouldn&#39;t want to fly with them.,1
UgyuxE7uG53aGEget-J4AaABAg.9_3f6lzoVN69_B2INjgkWG,"@Regina DuLac at the moment I wouldn&#39;t rule out anything: mechanical failure, terrorism, suicide/mass murder.",0
UgyuxE7uG53aGEget-J4AaABAg.9_3f6lzoVN69_B7YC0SoWu,"@Regina DuLac True, but this one has a bad smell about it. Now that I heard that the co-pilot was a captain who was demoted by the captain on this flight, this accident is nothing more than suicide, and the Chinese already know that!",1
UgyuxE7uG53aGEget-J4AaABAg.9_3f6lzoVN69_BzY2xSmCV,"@ki wi oh definitely, I’m not trying to rule out anything, just saying I feel that one situation is more likely than the other.",0
UgyuxE7uG53aGEget-J4AaABAg.9_3f6lzoVN69_K-NS6un6n,"When it recovered from the initial dive, to me that is enough proof that the aircrew shouldn&#39;t be blamed...what happens next is obvious that because of pulling high Gs to recover the plane,  the earlier stresses to the wings and control surfaces and the enormous forces from the pulling up, must have broken the wings thus you see the whole fuselage just vertically dove cos it no longer has wings. I suspect what triggered it is when the pilots disengage autopilot, as it was about to descend, approaching to land. Something obviously malfunctioned, could be even inputting wrong desired altitude that made the aircraft descent too rapidly, once something broke (trailing edge slats? Ailerons? there was something that broke off found further away from the 30m radius crash site that is the clue to what happened to it&#39;s aerodynamic configuration). So there are two parts to this: 1st what triggered the long dive? I suspect transition to descend <a href=""http://config.by/"">config.by</a> the time goes to 2nd part, damage have been done to the wing structures or control surfaces, not to mention inside the plane the load of things in cargo and so on have mostly shifted forward from aft position so that the plane is front heavy.",0
Ugwnu6DPjQExTcb4NNx4AaABAg.9_2JlC12LtU9_34e_via0T,The video says that plane does not have the mcas system,0
Ugwnu6DPjQExTcb4NNx4AaABAg.9_2JlC12LtU9_3CuY_3fyN,"@turi:I know right! But isn&#39;t it possible that there was a different system that would mimic action of mcas cause remember Boeing didn&#39;t disclose such until 2 737-800 max crashed? I thought of few likely causes, from Terrorism to Radar malfunction but that sudden deep nose dive at that high speed is very similar to what happened to Ethiopian airways. One thing for sure it&#39;s only deliberate action by a human being who could get the aircraft to that maximum speed. It&#39;s either pilot locked his companion out of cockpit and engage in his suicide mission Or pilot error misinterpreted his monitors thinking the aircraft was about to stall  when it was not resulting in him applying stall counteracting recovery protocols among which pushing controls forward at full speed to gather speed needed to gain lift and come out of stall.Nonetheless we could only speculate, let&#39;s wait for a final report.",0

A kinzhal has a range of 2250 and at mach 10 or higher it takes out US military craft before it gets in range.  I think this is the biggest reason we arent putting any amount of troops on the ground over there or a no fly zone, because whether or not the conflict goes nuclear they have the best quick strike capability, outside of doing something devious and dropping a warhead from suborbit or something. Chinese are workiing in that area of hypersonic tech tho, and I hear their delivery vehicles are 3000 mph and unlimited range.

Sure I doubt many Australians are immigrating to Russia, we also don&#39;t have a need for  Australian immigrants either. After the Soviet Union was illegally dissolved, (not collapsed as westerners liked to say), many people in the former soviet republics fled due to capitalist reforms that brought devastation. They were fleeing a country that was run by western backed leaders at the time, Gorbachev and Yeltsin. They werent fleeing Putin. There is no proof for the claim that millions of Russians want to migrate to Australia either, they are free to do so yet there are only 18 thousand Russian born people living in Australia.

Oil is not the only thing that keeps the world going.",0
UgxbhP4T05SmuGUj7FB4AaABAg.9ZzgYUUN7489_MX5sXcv3X,"@Maura Cassidy I comment point by point:
<br>America, Canada, Australia, Japan and the EU are not the whole world. The population of China, India, the Middle East, not to mention the rest of the world, is the whole world. What I see so far is that the countries unfriendly to Russia are punishing themselves as their lives become more expensive. Inflation in Russia for February was lower than in America and Europe. as they will now have to buy resources in other countries and for other money. Putin does not intersect in any way with the oligarchs and the Russian people, on the contrary, are happy that everything has been taken away from the oligarchs. Now the oligarchs will invest in their own country instead of taking money abroad.
<br>Putin doesn&#39;t care about your democracies. They will destroy themselves when their wallet is empty, a man will not think about democracy. Putin doesn&#39;t need Ukraine, he will only free the two eastern regions from Zelensky&#39;s thugs who have been killing Russians there for 8 years. Zelensky will stay in power if that is what the people of Ukraine want. Putin has a very good team (military, economists, politicians) that keeps him informed. He doesn&#39;t make decisions based on emotions, he is quite patient and intelligent. He was a spy in the KGB. He told me himself that he worked as a part-time cab driver in the &#39;90s to feed his family. Those were tough times. I, for example, was moonlighting as a cab driver back then, even though I had a full-time job. He doesn&#39;t need to be the richest, he doesn&#39;t need that. He works hard all the time. Wealth is not the main goal in life. You might as well dig into the dirty underwear of Biden and his drug addict and pedophile son Hunter.
<br>The Russian people&#39;s standard of living has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. In terms of foreign reserves Russia is in 4th place, while America is in 21st place. Even after Russia&#39;s 50% freeze, it&#39;s still twice as much as the U.S.&#39;s. Thus, the U.S. has signed the death warrant for the dollar and the euro. Every child knows the U.S. foreign debt when America untied gold from the dollar in 1971, which was essentially a technical default. Now the dollar, is a piece of paper that is not backed by anything and the weight of the dollar in the world will fall precipitously. Russia exports 25% more than it consumes (food, resources, machinery and equipment). China is the largest exporter of goods. America is a consumer country. Only Trump turned out to be smart when he started the procedure of transferring production to the U.S., but he was not allowed to work quietly. 
<br>Now the war is on with the hegemony of the dollar. Ukraine is receding into the background. But Europe and America either haven&#39;t figured it out yet or will figure it out later. Now everything Russian will be sold for rubles. The ruble is backed by a specific commodity. Now Russia will no longer sell anything cheaply, nor will it develop other economies to its detriment.
<br>In Ukraine, the war is on for the preservation of the Russian nation, which has been slaughtered for 8 years in eastern Ukraine. When the Ukrainian Nazis nail a man to a cross and burn him alive just for being Russian and speaking the Russian language. Now these will go to Europe, crime in Europe will skyrocket.
<br>About the political opponents you speak of. There is one example, Khodorkovsky, who is on every channel now. Who fraudulently took over the shares of YUKOS. Didn&#39;t pay people their salaries, but bought shares from them. On his birthday the mayor of Petukhov was killed. I lived in Nefteyugansk at the time and witnessed it, not read it in the newspapers. He was in prison, I was surprised he was released at all.
<br>And about the censorship. YouTube has blocked all Russian channels. We in Russia can see both your news and our news. But your population can only see theirs. And your channels unwittingly raise Putin&#39;s ratings because we see here what lies your channels carry. But we live in Russia. We know better what is sold in our stores, who needs it and who does not. I, my parents, my children do not need anything. My parents receive a normal pension. We all have cars, we don&#39;t care about gasoline at 0.5$. My children go to school for free. We can get free education, medical treatment. By comparison, in Russia 89% of the population have their own housing, in America 60%.",0

Ugwyxaj6Fd_0Ra45LwJ4AaABAg.9ZhC8tuVPAs9ZhJa9AIIPd,"@Susan Novak ... something for you to chew on...But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.

There were. a lot of smart people in the field. I was one of them. Because of my age and experience I have a keen eye on taxes and who pays them.

<br>
<br>russia started amassing troops at the border of ukrain ......(here&#39;s a first indicator here) many of those troops where reservists , russia then went on the offensive and attacked with those forces .....those forces couldn&#39;t really manage to well (this was intentional) to draw out the length of this conflict (with the intention of gauging reactions from other powers such as america and trying to draw them into the conflict) , russia attacked civilian targets with the intent of trying to draw in a confrontation with america (didn&#39;t work) instead the other powers placed severe sanctions on russia (putin at this point is getting angry about not drawing america or others in) so he makes a nuclear threat by putting his nuclear forces on alert in an attempt to draw a direct threat from america and others (also didn&#39;t work) now he attacks more civilian targets on a larger scale in his latest attempt to draw them in again.
<br>
<br>the entire point of this is putin wants to draw america or other nearby forces into a direct confrontation , if america went to war with russia then china + others would side with russia and it would be all out war against america ( this is the entire intent) and this is only going to escalate until he succeeds. russia is holding back the bulk of their forces for this instance , if russia really wanted the ukrain they could have taken it in a day easily or obliterated the entire place.<br><br>the troops doing idiotic things like this i suspect are reservists and in all probability criminals (those imprisoned and released as fodder with the promise of freedom) there&#39;s ben many criminal acts all over ukrain and little t no coordination of any kind.",0

For the last 8 years, the Zelensky regime (many of which are literally Nazi) have killed over 14,000 Ukranians in the Donbas region with US weapons.  This was before the Russian invasion.

And the mere fact that their President stayed back (knowing full well he is a walking target) instead of fleeing like the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani when the Taliban took over recently, is a marvel enough and is highly respectable. He’s a good leader, period, and NATO and the USA have to learn a lot from him. And this war, contrary to the West’s belief, has been incrementally provoked by the West themselves by breaking countless promises to Russia like you said, and expanding Eastwards. Yes, the West are nothing but hypocrites but whataboutism should not be used as an excuse by Russia either because two wrongs don’t make a right. Hope I’ve cleared everything up.",0

At least the wife&#39;s reaction suggests that nothing in this regard was previously discussed. In addition, as a nurse, you should know that this dose of 1000 µg was clearly too high. As an anesthesiologist I can confirm that pain patients receive a dose of 12µg/h to 150µg/h. However, these are opioid-addicted patients. A patient who is not used to opioids will inevitably die of respiratory depression (at least without further respiratory support) on 1000 µg fentanyl.<br>Fentanyl has an approximately 120-fold greater analgesic potency than morphine.

UgykiQ3MBrFEjEBfrkN4AaABAg.9YkraC9s61X9YqBVIuy139,@Silver Damsen  That is a lot to digest. <br>I remember when this whole opioid crisis started. Pain was considered the 5th vital sign. (IMO it is to subjective. ). If Providers did not aggressively treat pain then they would not get reimbursed at minimum. They could lose their license at worst. <br>Then the same groups that made those rules demand that the prescription stop or slow down. I agree we get people dependent on these   meds then stop them. They go somewhere else to get them.  That has led to the accidental overdoses. Heaven knows what is in drugs they are buying.  <br>As far as prescribing fentanyl from the pharmacy legally.  A couple things. 1. Fentanyl is strong but tolerance is built up fairly quickly. That may explain the large dose. 2. These people were CMO. The families had agreed nothing but palliative measures were to be done.   <br>If states start prosecuting  healthcare workers for doing their job. Then no sane person would practice palliative medicine. We all know when laws are made DAs can make them fit any agenda.,0
UgykiQ3MBrFEjEBfrkN4AaABAg.9YkraC9s61X9Yqc9XzqvPJ,"@Michael Martin we share some key concerns here. To prosecute doctors for pllative medicine will change medicine and not in a good way. And this is also strange since supposedly the word is that the restrictions on prescription are going to ease up.<br><br>Before doctors doing pallative care had more freedom but those on non-terminal conditions were under obligation to give only the barest take home pain medication and if they could get away with prescribing nothing, then prescribe nothing. So many people have suffered with dental surgery because of this. There was someone in one of my HR discussion groups that was basically losing her mind because her wisdom teeth had been pulled and they refused to give her anything for pain. I suspect she looked her own dealer up in the end.<br><br>There is the issue of creating demand but the thing is the group that benefits from that is not Big Pharma, it is drug cartels and weapons manufacturers so it was poor planning if anyone seriously expected to make money via legal prescription off of opioids.<br><br>I think the demand issue is overplayed too. The crack down on prescriptions has been in place since at least 2014 and even earlier than that, but Od d*ath keep growing.  In theory if prescriptions were causing that many new &quot;addicts&quot; the severe restrictions on prescriptions for pain killers should have reduced the number of new &quot;addicts,&quot; that it didn&#39;t argues that the narrative is incorrect. <br><br>If policy was correct on the relationship of prescription opioids to &quot;addiction,&quot; we would have seen a decrease or at least a leveling off. The OD rate has gone from 20k in 1999 to over a 100k last year. I think only one year  had a OD rate slightly less than the year before and that was lauded as the turning point--and yet we had 100k OD d*aths last year.

Ugyu8leELMLP2DlDzih4AaABAg.9YknNwFqhUm9Yr9BeWNzM8,We use it often for mild sedation for minimal invasive surgery. Like in a cath lab. Usually the nurse administers  drugs not the doctor. If he gave the patient 1000mcg of fentanyl then that means the ICU nurse refused to do it. Nurses question doses of any drug out of the norm. When you are in a hospital and the doctor is giving you drugs( they have minimal training in drug administration) you should be very worried. Most doctors don&#39;t have a clue how to work an IV pump or how to draw up medication. This is malpractice.,0

UgxjkhcTHgjPSjOQhzd4AaABAg.9Ykjgy3A2UF9YuVVyi_XD8,"One important distinction in the analogy is that a doctor&#39;s life is not at risk if he fails to treat the patient to the standard of care.  So in a medical emergency, a doctor has to act quickly to the best of his ability - to try to spare the patient&#39;s life.  Stressful?  For sure.  But the doctor only has the patient&#39;s welfare to think of in that moment.  In some emergencies, a cop is trying to make sure that he doesn&#39;t get shot during the incident.  So, a policeman may have a more complex set of threats to sort through, potentially in a mere moment.  For that reason, qualified immunity seems appropriate...though it does have to have reasonable standards and then excellent training to those standards.  Who would be a police officer without qualified immunity?

UgxasoS2uEXtZS_gTAF4AaABAg.9YkhRyrkjyO9YkjajvEk3F,No no that’s not the case. Near death most people aren’t hungry or thirsty and it wouldn’t be right to force someone to eat or drink near death when they don’t want to or may be painful for them. Opioids are used to manage pain (could also cause them not to want to eat possibly drink). The breathing machine (I’m guessing normal nasal cannula with air) was so he was comfortable and not suffocate to death. Hospice will give supportive care until death and a nasal cannula with oxygen and opioids are sometimes part of that. Trust me he wasn’t starved to death unless he asked for food or water and denied it and at that point it’s wrong.,0

He may have felt he was being merciful and the courts will determine his guilt or innocence.   Years ago when my father was terminal I know the nurse gave him a higher than usual dose of morphine..  However, the nurse also told me the dosage and I knew his death would be moments away.  We were able to gather around him and say goodbye.  Three years ago my mother passed much in the same way.  I had been living with her in the palliative care unit in the hospital and she passed with the sound of all her loved ones speaking to her as she gently drifted away.  Not one cent came out of anyone&#39;s pocket.  Now it is possible to pass in your own bed at home if you are palliative.  No corporate heath care.  Universal health care.

<br>
<br> <br>Greg McMichael stated  on record that Arbery was &quot; trapped like a rat &quot; ,and &quot;  &quot;I think he was wanting to flee and he realized that something, you know, he was not going to get away. This helps create the mindset that Arbery  felt that his options were very  limited even if logically they were not ,and that escape would be impossible even  if he picked a better choice.  It can even be argured that the verbal threats made towards Arbery ,and Bryan entering the chase ,and trying to run him into a ditch impaired Arbery&#39;s ability to make rational choices. 
<br>
<br><br>Why did Travis McMichael leave the protection of the car with gun in hand? By leaving the car he put himself in more danger as it would be easier for Arbery to attack him since he is now out in the open ,and it would be harder to drive away since he was the actual driver. His father wasn&#39;t in  any danger either as Arbery was still a bit behind from catching up to them. 
<br>
<br><br>Based on the verdict of both trials, Arbery had the legal right to take the shotgun,and kill all three defendants . Arbery had the right to self defense as soon as they started attempting to illegally detain him. 
<br>
<br><br>That footage wasn&#39;t allowed as no one had knowledge that the suspect was actually Arbery at that time. None of their actions were based on having knowledge on how Arbery may act when confronted pretty much. 
<br>
<br><br>English did  report fishing equipment being  stolen,however the problem with that claim is that he didn&#39;t know when ,and where it happened. Police even admitted that they were looking for Arbery to give him a trespass warning ,and not like a burglary charge.",0

UgyseVHHrqNg9Fd3R1x4AaABAg.9YzOMZ0C6Iw9Z5EI_dLPML,"​@Ideal Idol Hey man, thanks for sharing this, I do appreciate the comment. <br><br>Regarding jobs, though there&#39;s been the largest job growth, we&#39;ve also had one of the largest loss of jobs last year (whether people leaving voluntarily or being let go). They were almost incentivized but extending a heavy sum for social security benefits. Under Biden&#39;s administration people would make more on unemployment than employment, leading to a major reason for the exodus. But there are also likely other proponents to this. <br><br>Secondly, his handling of foreign policy. What has happen on the southern border, is an actual crisis. People are flooding in from Mexico illegally without much restriction, and it&#39;s actually bombarding our border police. Beyond this, Biden left us in a crisis in Afghanistan, leaving millions of dollars of weaponry, and causing havoc there. <br><br>We are also now energy dependent. In Trump&#39;s administration we had oil/fuel being drilled domestically but now we are dependent on Saudi Arabia, Russia and other nations to mainly supply our rescores. <br><br> We&#39;ve experienced the highest rate of inflation since the 1980&#39;s. Though wages have increased across the board, so has the cost of living. It was said that unless someone received a 8% raise from their positions last year, they would actually be taking a pay deduction from their workplace.  We also to continue to go into billions of dollars of debut, and the more bills that are passed through this president, the further the dollar will loose it&#39;s value. <br><br>COVID- Biden had created an oppressive system whereby he has and will continue to introduce COVID mandates to be vaccinated. That is oppressive, people should have the right the choose if they want a vaccine, especially seeing it&#39;s not proven to have great efficacy against new variants, and it was rapidly approved by the FDA. <br><br> Though he has eased his rhetoric about this over the last few months, I remember last year comments he was making. I can only imagine another variant, causing him to create further mandates. Furthermore, he has taken credit for a vaccine that Trump introduced, and he has gotten 215 millon people vaccinated, but mainly through oppressive means, and all the while touting his achievement of the vaccine. Moreover, under Biden&#39;s policy, more people contracted and died from COVID comparative to Trump&#39;s administration. And Biden during the presidential elections said &quot;anyone who is responsible for this many death is not fit to be president.&quot; The irony of his words now.  <br><br>He&#39;s also establishing judges that though diverse (and I will agree with you on that point), <br><br> the dogma from our legislators is often very progressive and quite often destructive. The whole BLM movement itself, and LGTBQ movement has created a cancel culture to a degree that has left people feeling censored and without a &quot;Freedom of Speech.&quot; It has segregated us very deeply. <br><br><br>Ultimately, I share all this because you asked and wanted to share honestly my position, but also in calling out some of the things Biden has done, I actually pray for him daily. I pray for his salvation most of all, that he would lead our nation uprightly, and that he would have wisdom from the Lord. In this time we are in, it&#39;s ultimately not a politician, but Jesus we need, and my prayer is that Biden would see that.",0

A better description would be: The cost of living is a tiny fraction of a wealthy person&#39;s income, but the majority of a poor person&#39;s income.<br><br>That doesn&#39;t mean people always spend money wisely, but it would be asinine to imagine that is the primary mechanism in that relationship.<br><br>The wealthy are large scale savers because even yachts and diamond tipped canes only cost so much, so to speak. The value of each incremental dollar is less in real terms because you are progressing along a list in order of priority, and you run out of high priority purchases, then middle-priority and so on (to employ inappropriately coarse granularity). Particularly in the US where, for instance, given health cost inflation is way above average inflation, and people on middle incomes get hit hard by that, among other things, the position has declined over time for most americans.<br><br>Certainly, saving is an economic virtue where possible, but to reverse the causation is foolish. Saving doesn&#39;t make your wealthy unless you can afford to save rather a lot. But being wealthy does make it trivial to save. It&#39;s a positive feedback mechanism that should be fairly easy to understand, though there are far far more positive feedback mechanisms involved in growing wealth inequality.<br><br>It&#39;s a very complex and broad, intersectional topic, but generally the best indicator of future economic success is past economic advantage.",0

Ugw4VY3rUmVSyh0BL_94AaABAg.9YdqRxSgAqm9YfXVPAHw6_,Robinson helicopter use a lightweight rotor system. Auto-rotation is all about trying to keep as much momentum in the blades as possible by trading altitude and speed for energy in the blades. In the event of a loss of power the reaction time is very short compared to other helicopters because of this. Simulated engine outs are one thing but in a actual failure in a Robinson... you might have 1-2 seconds tops before the momentum in the rotor system is insufficient for auto-rotation.,0

UgzkDLacpA8oLyftjc94AaABAg.9YdmbAut8Qx9Ydp07w4vcg,"@Vital Signs in order to fly a helicopter you need to understand that given enough altitude should you suffer engine failure you can land the aircraft using the inertia created before malfunction. This is called auto-gyration. When l went for my licence the most important prequisite in the test was auto-gyration. You take the chopper to 10,000ft &amp; the Instructor turns off the engine to simulate engine failure in a heli, failure to land under auto-gyration conditions and you don&#39;t get a licence to fly.",0
UgzkDLacpA8oLyftjc94AaABAg.9YdmbAut8Qx9YdpTQjKsFQ,@Vital Signs Autorotation (or auto-gyration) is the state of flight where the main rotor system is being turned by the force of the relative wind rather than engine power. It is the means by which a helicopter can be landed safely in the event of an engine failure.,0
UgzkDLacpA8oLyftjc94AaABAg.9YdmbAut8Qx9YfV79pi0w4,@warpedjaffas1 AUTO-GYRATION??? BAHAHAHAHA… how to spot the difference between a liar and a pilot… if the engine is turned off and you fail... there is no way to regain momentum in the rotor system. Which means you and your instructor become a falling rock. When your engine is off in flight it is NOT a simulated auto-rotation. Its an actual emergency…,1
