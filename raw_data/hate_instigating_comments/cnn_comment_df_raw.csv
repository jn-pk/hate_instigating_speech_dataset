UgzRo83sFh3mb8Bq2Mp4AaABAg,"Re: Putin&#39;s motives. He knows that he can never defeat the West. But the closest he could come to defeating the West is to have a nuclear war, one that will destroy most of the West, and most of the East, but he just might survive, and be hailed as the champion or Russia. Further, even if he didn&#39;t survive, he considers he will go down in history as the champion of Russia. This IS his off-ramp. At his age, after his years of struggle as a leader, a nuclear war serves as his swan song, and he is singing it to himself as the West tries to figure out what he is &quot;thinking.&quot; This motive makes sanctions, loss of popular appeal,  bombing of hospitals and schools and humanitarian routes irrelevant to Putin, since the final result makes all of those just unimportant, if not moot points along the way to the massive destruction contemplated, accepted, and/or even hoped for. This ugly motive is of course deniable, but I say it is his  intention, and that he is perfectly willing to risk it all in order to have this big &quot;win&quot; as part of his legacy.

UgxXU-TnhhKhBX5YGQ14AaABAg,"I occasionally have epiphanies where my mind puts together the pattern of humanity and will have a sudden flash of realization that seems to come out of the blue.  I am going to state what I Know is Putin&#39;s plan for Ukraine and then I will state why this makes so much sense.  <br><br>Please read it and I hope to God, as I usually do with this kind of epiphany, that I am wrong (which I haven&#39;t been so far when this happens and can easily prove that I predicted the delta and omnivirus and even trump&#39;s coup long before anyone else did if I need to)...<br><br>Putin may be a habitual liar but when he said it was all going to plan, he wasn&#39;t lying.  He is going to wipe out Ukrainians, and his soldiers that are there, through chemical warfare.  It&#39;s going to be widespread and horrific with a mass amount of death like we have never seen before.  <br><br>This is why I have came to this conclusion:<br><br>1). Putin can&#39;t afford to let the soldiers back into his country as they are witnesses to his lies.  It&#39;s the reason the Russian troops that try to go home to Russia are being shot and killed for &quot;retreating&quot;.<br><br>2).  Putin wants the land, he doesn&#39;t give a f*ck about the people that live there.<br><br>3.). Putin has 2 million at his disposal and yet only has 150 thousand troops on the ground in Ukraine.  He has a huge weaponry arsenal and yet the troops on the ground have weaponry that is falling apart and old.  Of course.  He views the troops as disposable as the old weaponry.  He is going to wipe the population of Ukraine out and sent in troops to sacrifice so he can use the narrative of chemical warfare from the enemies.  This will give the Russian army what they don&#39;t already have, a Cause.  A reason to fight, a reason to die, a reason to invade other nations for Putin&#39;s insatiable instinct of expanding his territory.<br><br>The troops he sent and gave orders to commit widespread murder amongst civilians, women, children... He will never allow them to come home and risk speaking out about what they have done on Putin&#39;s orders. There is no way he would allow that to happen.  <br><br>4). He has repeatedly tested his nerve agent and I guarantee he has been making it in mass to employ it in his conquest of power.  <br><br>5). He probably feels like he is showing mercy by killing civilians, women, and children because the nerve agent he will use is so horrendous that a quick death seems like a mercy to him.<br><br>6. Without looking it up, I guarantee the majority of troops he has on the ground right now are not seasoned veterans but new recruits, cadets, etc.  <br><br>7.  Initially, he thought Ukraine would quickly fall to even the old equipment and second string troops and would have preferred it that way but he has always had a back up plan of this just in case.<br><br>8). Narcissists are quick to accuse everyone else of what they themselves are doing.  He is setting up the blackflag narrative for chemical warfare but we overestimate how much he values his troops that are there.  He doesn&#39;t.<br><br>9.). Nothing has been making sense,he has been trying to lull us into a false security with this entire endeavor.  He sends in green troops with breaking down equipment,no food, no fuel, commiting war crimes in mass while spitting out propaganda in Russia even enforcing a 15 year term just for calling it a war.  Russians can&#39;t communicate with their loved ones that have been employed to Ukraine.  Russia asking for money when Putin is most likely the wealthiest person in the world.  How can he not have reserves, umbrella companies, etc??  They spend so much money on their military and yet run out of food and fuel in 2 weeks in old tanks with only 150,000 troops????  NONE OF THAT MAKES A LICK OF SENSE!!<br><br>Most likely, if he did ask China it was to test China&#39;s allegiance.  <br><br>Putin is going to kill every person in the major cities of Ukraine whether Russian or Ukrainian.  It doesn&#39;t matter to him, it never does to those kinds of psychopaths.  He is fooling everyone, that is the driving force behind the smirk he is always wearing.  Convinced he has outwitted the rest of the world.<br><br>I can&#39;t do anything to stop it, I can&#39;t save them.  I&#39;m just a single mom who is an ENTP (The Visionary of Myers-Briggs personality test) and occasionally has moments of deep insight.  But what&#39;s the point if nothing can be done about it unless someone with the resources notices it too.  <br><br>Please, God, let me bring wrong.  Let me look like nothing more than another crazy conspiracy theorist talking out of left field.

How did she determine that it was the Russian military? The shape of both is almost the same. I think she made such a conclusion only on the basis of confidence that her own (that is, the Ukrainian military) would not shoot at their own. And if she&#39;s wrong? After all, it has already become known that in addition to the military of Ukraine and Russia, another side is involved in the conflict - Ukrainian nationalists. They do not obey Kiev. They equally hate the Russian army and the Ukrainian people, who do not want to fight. They see people like this girl as a human shield. The Russian side has evidence of Nazi executions of refugees in Mariupol, Kharkiv and Kiev. The city of Mariupol has been turned into ruins by these nationalist formations. To understand this, you just need to come there and honestly look at everything. But this is exactly what the world media does not want to show.

Ugyy-Wjds6t1qAVWwEd4AaABAg,"Russians and Ukrainians defend themselves against fascism, not only pro-Russian Ukrainians, but Ukrainians who want to live in peace. They defend themselves from the fascist Ukrainians, from fascism decanted into ukroneonazism, they defend themselves from
<br>far-right political parties that have armed arms, neo-Nazi paramilitaries financed by &quot;democratic&quot; countries, such as Pravyi Sektor, Svoboda, or the Azov battalion.
<br>It does not surprise me that the Presidents of passes
<br>Europeans who are colonies of England square with transnational finance capital and the instruction that was given to them. They do not govern, let&#39;s be honest, but the English send them.
<br>Peace cannot be guaranteed with only

<br>position as the only empire, the only form of relationship.
<br>Neoliberalism is a far-right position with enormous differences in the vision of society and the State with fascism, however they converge, they coincide in too many
<br>stuff. They agree on what and for whom the State should serve, they agree on the role of the Subject within society according to them, they agree on being anti-communist, they agree on imposing class dictatorship institutionalizing the
<br>violence of law, coincide in the use of force and State violence, coincide in the installation of a legal architecture that is nothing more than the institutionalized violence of law in pursuit of economic exploitation
<br>of the working class, political domination and social and cultural oppression, coincide in the precariousness of political, social and human rights, and coincide in having a great military and repressive muscle, be it state or as a
<br>currently in the Anglo-Saxons, privatized, privatizing wars in s. They also share the monopoly, totalitarian imperial vision, and clearly the fascist stench. Thus, fascism, like neoliberalism, relativizes the brutal
<br>human rights violations, relativize history itself, normalize state violence, blurring, and using the Nietzschean rhetoric that &quot;there is no truth but interpretations&quot; absolute fallacy, ideological and devoid of
<br>rationality and position of facts.
<br>That &quot;appears&quot; and that there is a resurgence of fascism, Nazism and visions of the Ultra Right in Great Britain, Germany, Spain, the Baltic countries, Poland etc., is not something circumstantial or
<br>coincidence, but a holistic and instrumentally rational premeditated political work, and that is gigantic, which responds to an international agenda, which has the Hegelian purpose of the absolute, the positioning of a matrix in
<br>all areas in a one-dimensional and subordinate way, with traces and guidelines long before the High Middle Ages, with the Order of the Garter, the so-called Merchants of Venice in the Renaissance by J. Le Goff, until the
<br>current Zionist synarchy anchored in London.
<br>There is enormous capital funding coming from Western security and intelligence agencies answerable to the Anglo-Saxons, which operate through foundations,
<br>religions and NGOs all over the world, operating jointly with political parties, sectors, clubs from different countries that seem innocent venues where the ladies go to have tea, and the gentlemen to have their exotic drinks,
<br>grassroots organizations, ideological media, infiltrators in the various levels of the state apparatus, such as Justice, Education (private schools, universities), Armed Forces, municipalities, positioning a society
<br>valiantly more and more prone to the loss of the capacity for astonishment as well as for action in the face of such risk, just as a frog loses the notion of being killed, when it is slowly boiled.
<br>It has carried us for decades, if not for
<br>throughout history, to normalize violence. In the movies and television we see nothing but violence, in the news the same thing, the sports logic is nothing more than that too, why speak of educational competition, just like the
<br>labor dispute between the working class, all of them, ultimately an expression of the class struggle, which is hidden by the powers in dispute.
<br>I feel that positioning oneself in rhetorical places of peace is a white cloth raised in flight,
<br>given its merely literary power, it is diluted and only becomes aware when the real danger knocks on the door of those who think irresponsibly in this way, only then does he realize that it was and is a great mistake to think like that, a fatal mistake.
<br>the cloth
<br>at that moment, to be dyed blood red, however it would already be late, too late.
<br>As a friend and colleague says &quot;the old does not just die, and the new is born, and like all childbirth, it will be painful.&quot;
<br>An economic crisis is coming
<br>and not only economic, watch out, but a debacle of democracy in a liberal key in the West, and the most affected countries will be the neoliberal and social democrats as peripheral.
<br>New trade routes and a new financial system
<br>Eurasian, present a new ontological vision of the human being. Thus, the East makes its way and positions itself above the West in the face of the one-dimensional denial of the Anglo-Saxons against a democratic multipolarity.
<br>She fell,
<br>is never respected, neither by its enemies, nor by its masters, thus, social democrats and neoliberals of Presidents of their Republics will become mere administrators of the pain paid in installments by the people of their countries in the face of the crisis and a
<br>new famine that a good part of the world will have to live through, all due to the monopoly desire, greed and envy, and Anglo-Saxon imperialist perversity.

UgxxgSRVZWXFmDO7fWh4AaABAg,"World War III Has Begun; How It Unfolds Depends on Us<br><br>We think of the Russia-Ukraine war as a local conflict, but it is much more than that; it is a global war on multiple fronts. The war is not only a military conflict; it is also an economic war of attrition. With skyrocketing gas prices and shortage of staples, people all over the world are feeling the consequences of the war.<br><br>This war is transforming the entire modus operandi of humanity. Since the dawn of time, we have been accustomed to living by the motto, “survival of the fittest.” By and large, the rule was that the strong determined the rules, and the rules were often abusive toward the weak. Now, it seems like a new mindset has set in: Wanting something and being strong enough to take it does not mean that the world will accept it.<br><br>The war, therefore, is being fought on the inside no less, and perhaps more than on the outside. Our very makeup is changing from abusive to cooperative, from narcissistic to altruistic.<br><br>It hurts, and it will not happen without a struggle, but it is irreversible. This is the path of our evolution toward the purpose of our creation—to encompass within us all of creation. To do that, we must come to care for it, just as a mother encompasses her child through her maternal love.<br><br>The struggle to transition from our current uncaring and mean approach to all creations but ourselves, into wise and compassionate beings is called “the war of Gog and Magog” or Armageddon.<br><br>Since the war is about our inner makeup, we can fight it within us. If we object to struggling with ourselves over who will rule—the ego or love—the physical reality will force us to choose love nonetheless. However, it will do so by hurting us in a very physical way.<br><br>The war in Eastern Europe is nothing compared to what we might have to endure if we resist the process. The horrific descriptions of our sages and prophets hint at it, and we would not want to live through it.<br><br>Alternatively, we can fight this war within us without firing a single bullet. The choice is in our hands. All we need is to continue in the same direction that nature is already leading us: toward connection. If we make an effort to care for one another, even though initially we don’t, then we are moving in the right direction. If we try to resolve conflicts not with guns or even legal battles, but by strengthening the care and friendship between us, then we are saving lives and sparing torments from countless people.<br><br>In conclusion, let us try to rise above the hatred and see the human on the other side, who suffers too. Let us think that this war was given to us so we would think about each other more than we have so far. After all, were it not for this war, we would not notice one another. Now that it is here, we are no longer indifferent. Although our feelings our currently negative, now that we are aware of them, we can work on them together and turn them around. These are the wars of the Messiah who moshech [Hebrew: pulls] us out of the ego, and into mutual love.",0.5,0

<br>(Obs: Rapture before the time of temptation, which will be the government of the antichrist during the great tribulation)
<br>
<br><i>For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 1 Thessalonians 4:16 MEV</i>
<br>(Obs: Rapture)
<br>
<br><b><i>For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</i></b><i> Matthew 24:38‭-‬39 MEV</i>
<br>(Obs: People will not be eating and drinking and marrying during the great tribulation, therefore, rapture will happen before the great tribulation, when people are still distracted)
<br>
<br><i>When they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape. 1 Thessalonians 5:3 MEV</i>
<br>(Obs: Sudden destruction near the rapture)
<br>
<br><b><i>Two will be in the field; one will be taken, and the other left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken, and the other left.</i></b><i> Matthew 24:40‭-41 MEV</i>
<br>(Obs: Rapture)
<br>
<br><i>Know this first, that there shall come scoffers in the last days who walk after their own lusts, and say, “Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things have continued as they were since the beginning of the creation.” 2 Peter 3:3‭-4 MEV</i>
<br>(Obs: Apostasy of the last days, when more and more men are denying God and going after their own sinful desires)
<br>
<br><i>But the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat. The earth also and the works that are in it will be burned up. 2 Peter 3:10 MEV</i>
<br>(Obs: The destructions that will happen after the rapture, just as the days of Sodom and Gomorrah; the righteous are rescued and the judgements are poured upon the wicked. &quot;like a thief in the night&quot; means it will happen when you do not expect. &quot;heavens will pass away&quot; means the sky will vanish as a scroll that is being rolled up, which is mentioned in Revelation 6:14)
<br>
<br><i>He causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that no one may buy or sell, except he who has the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name. Revelation 13:16‭-17 MEV</i>
<br>(Obs: In the last days, no one will be able to buy or sell without a mark from the government/beast of the antichrist, which will take place during the great tribulation, which is at the door)
<br>
<br><i>But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book until the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase.” Daniel 12:4 MEV</i>
<br>(Obs: In the last days, many will travel to many places and knowledge will be increased)
<br>
<br><b><i>“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.</i></b><i> John 3:16 MEV</i>
<br>
<br>Behold, the Lord of lords is coming soon, repent now of all your sins —stay away from all sins— and abide in the only Savior and Lord Jesus, the Christ, (Yeshua, the Messiah) with all your heart, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.",0.0,0

UgyKv9LDQFdDvQmQLR54AaABAg,1.Forensic autopsy these are facts in the case this is the only thing you look at in the case are the facts Fact one by the forensic specialist two places on the black man&#39;s body were mere fragments from a shotgun blast hit the body which the forensic specialist said didn&#39;t make any sense because these are not the kind of blasts that a malice murderer would use<br>2. That&#39;s why the forensic specialist said it didn&#39;t make any sense until he seen the video coverage of Ahmaud attacking the white individual with the shotgun! When the forensic specialist saw the wrestling match scuffle of the two wrestling over the shotgun the white individual said he pulled the trigger one time because his finger is caught around the trigger Ahmaud during the wrestling match scuffle shot the shotgun twice in order for this to be malice murder the white individual had to take one shotgun blast the full blast of the shotgun and shoot it through the blackbody of Ahmaud that would have been an outright malice murder but according to the forensic specialist in according to the video coverage none of this malice murder took place! This bad prosecutor has tried to pull something on the whole United States of America that is watching to see who is smart and who is dumb and so far they&#39;ve made the whole news media and everyone in the United States look dumb as they can be the smarter people of the United States of America is not going to let this bad prosecutor pull this stunt with this bad courtroom and a bad jury that wanted to go home for the holidays) in order to have a malice murder it had to take a whole shotgun blast to the body in other words they outright murdered the man they blew his head off) this did not take place! In the video coverage that shows Ahmaud attacking the white individual with the shotgun which caused the wrestling match scuffle over the shotgun the white man admitted he shot the gun one time this means that Ahmaud shot the gun 2 times because there was three shotgun blast during the wrestling match scuffle over the firearm it appears that all three individual white people had firearms if it was malice murder they would have all blew holes through Ahmaud this would have been a malice murder so under the facts of the case there is no way we can pull malice murder and now you have a malicious prosecution with the wrong charges on three individuals the shotgun was the only one shot three times the white man on the witness stand emitted of shooting the gun one time during the wrestling match scuffle of the firearm based on these facts there is no malice murder involved but now you have a malicious prosecution and a bad prosecutor that just wanted to win a case and you have a bad jury that just wanted to go home for the holidays that didn&#39;t appear to have the intelligence to go through the factual evidence and information,1.0,1

It won&#39;t be much longer until you absolutely cannot say one single negative thing about Trump or ppl that support him without pointing the finger at yourselves. You all are losing so fast it&#39;s not even funny. The entire WORLD sees this but you all somehow do not. Literally in the same segment on attempting to cast doubt on his good character by questioning how much he&#39;s really worth, you show a clip of of him literally telling you to your faces how much he&#39;s worth. Lmfao!! He even told you a few years ago that he absolutely takes advantage of the tax loopholes that GOVERNMENT created. If you all have such a problem with this... Tell your majority democrat ruling to close these loopholes. I&#39;ll bet my last dollar that they will NEVER do this.

To give you an example, 100 -200 mcg of Fentanyl is enough for induction to anaesthesia. In my country it has been replaced (for safety reasons) by Alfentanyl in palliation and the total dose over 24h is 3 mg (3000mcg). Fentanyl is given only as transdermal patches and it is considered a last resort <br>2. The controlled drugs stewardship should be very strict and there is a managerial issue in this case. There is no way that I would request for 1000mcg of Fentanyl and the nurse in charge or the ward pharmacist would dispense this.

This is because nearly every oil-exporting country in the world exclusively sells their oil in dollars, so nations are forced to hoard large amounts of the dollar.<br>There are two countries that don&#39;t sell their oil in the dollar: Syria, and Iran.<br>If these two countries joined forces, got Venezuela on their side, maybe a few other countries, and then made an economic treaty with the BRICS nations, an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, to buy their oil in a currency other than the US dollar, the economy would collapse<br>All countries in the world would send their massive hoards of the dollar back to the Fed in exchange for whichever currency replaces it. The value of the dollar would shrink dramatically and the Fed would be forced to take steps to shrink the money supply to stem massive inflation. The raising of the Federal Funds rate would mean that there would not be enough new loans created to pay off old loans (which is necessary, because there is always more debt in the economy than there is money, because money is created with interest attached, from the very beginning we are all indebted to a small cabal that sits behind the federal reserve). The defaulting of loans would lead to a chain reaction that would collapse the $700,000,000,000,000 derivatives market. In addition, the Fed wouldn&#39;t be able to mindlessly pump money into the economy anymore such as with their current policy of quantitative easing.<br>In 2001, Iraq began selling their oil in the Euro. We invaded.<br>In 2010 Gaddafi proposed a new currency called the Gold Dinar to replace the dollar for oil sales. We bombed the shit out of his country and caused a regime change.<br>Syria moved away from the Dollar in 06 and Iran in 08. That is what this is all about. There are other geopolitical objectives, sure, such as the pipeline that Syria signed with Iran instead of the US friendly Qatar, but the Petrodollar is the king. It is literally the only reason the dollar and US economy is stable. The entirety of the Western financial elite need the Petrodollar system and they are willing to go to war and kill millions to defend it. Recently Russia signed huge oil deals with China in EURO. So both Russia and Europe must be weakened. There goes Ukraine.<br>Some food for thought: how are they able to keep discussion about the petrodollar completely out of the mainstream media and politics? Hundreds, maybe thousands of people acting in concert to lie to the American people for another war. And they will do the same after Ukraine.",0.0,0

UgyS9WRZfA_7Llo2sHV4AaABAg,"Fox went after AOC right from the very beginning.  I used to follow their website regularly, and for almost an entire year, there would a negative piece on her pretty much every single day.  They viewed her as both a threat, and a money (ratings) opportunity.  She has not defended herself well IMO.  How can she?  I don&#39;t know the answer to that, but I do know my mother hates her.  My mom is the end result of constant media bashing by Fox and now Newsmax etc...but also Evangelical outlets.",1.0,0

The fact that America have allowed Tucker Carlson to do as he pleases from day one speaks volumes - you guys only have yourselves to blame.
