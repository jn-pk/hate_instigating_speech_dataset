Ugys1dt4O0iu0Gis3Hh4AaABAg.9ZYXROC6ImW9ZdXr0BLJ-W,"What you are saying about the cause of pump prices is incorrect. The oil companies actually absolutely need to increase production to lower costs. However, they put out a  statement 2 weeks ago stating that they absolutely will NOT increase production, even now. AND, for those that keep whining about the ""Keystone Pipeline,"" let's  clear that up.The Keystone Pipeline (which runs fuel into the U.S.) is still running.The Keystone XL , which went through multiple tribal lands, and was specifically for oil production waste, and oil  specified by Canada to be shipped overseas, is the one which was shut down.It doesn't  even belong to the U.S.I don't care what Trump SAID. I KNOW what he did.  And what he did was buy out all the oil to keep pump prices artificially low, and when that move started ""tanking"" the oil companies, he bailed them out with billion$ and they made a huge profit on the bailouts.It was going to comeback to bite us some time or other because  basically he was doing the equivalent of racking up charges on a credit card. It might have taken 8 years if he kept pushing it ( but that bill would have kept growing in size).Either way, the next president would be stuck with a bill Trump basically  racked up, and then be blamed for record inflation. And believe me, that ""record inflation"" would have been exponentially worse after 8 years.All, of course, was Trump's plan. Which is exactly why he (and most economists) were able to ""predict"" it. He's  no prophet.He's  messed up his own businesses  enough to know how to do it to leave other people holding the bag.I'm  not surprised at his maneuvers. It is exactly how he runs his businesses and exactly why he has declared bankruptcy 10x in 30 years.It doesn't  work that way in a government  economy however. It ends up being WE who pay for it.Putin's  disgusting moves have just exasperated a problem that Trump had already set in motion.",0

Oil has already been disrupted and communist countries are already in talks with Saudi Arabia to use their own currency for trade as this war continues. The person who wrote this is Spot on.

Sport is about stamina and etc, you want females compete against a biologically male?, their stamina is different.

No, cuz the law is equal for both gender. NOW, if you agree and accept that trans people are actually the gender they claim they are and not their actual biological gender, and you want it also to be recognized by the government, and accept them as women, then you have to treat them like women legally too, which includes benifits like sports, no draft etc. You cant have the cake and eat it when they beat you at ur own sport.

If the female athletes against this, then you should respect them to because they think it's not fair to compete against a biologically male. I didn't say anything about trans people can't do the same job or anything. I won't and can't listen to someone that wrongly used ""Feminism and misogynistic"" to support their opinion and attacks people on the internet that have no ill intention like me.

India received support from the USSR and Pakistan continued to receive support from the US. Fast forward to the 21st century and you still have the US supporting Pakistan despite the fact that they hid Bin Laden and carried out terror attacks in India (e.g. 2008 Mumbai terror attacks). You can't blame the Indians for wanting to remain neutral and not say anything that would jeopardise their relationship with Russia. India and the US have never been allies. India is nothing but a mere tool for the US to use in order to contain China within Asia. This is what the US-supporting Indians and the India-supporting Americans need to understand.

This is all the more reason we need to be neutral and stay out of this war. If we are forced to pick choices for a war that is so far away from us for a mere 40 million people, our 1.2 billion will suffer. None of the choices are worth losing either of the west or Russia's support. Maybe one day we can start the third world again, wgen we are strong enough. Till then, keeping our heads down and waiting is what we can do. We cannot afford to do anything else in faraway wars. Europeans may care about Ukrainains more but we have Afghanistan and Myanmar conflicts to care about. Srilanka is broke and there's a race for power in that region, nepal is getting closer to china, china is still a threat and pakistan is in political instability again, meaning the military is still pulling the shots there.

Who will do these jobs if everyone moves into ""more lucrative"" work??? The rich folks aren't going to do their own laundry, or clean their houses, or drive their own limo's. These are the service folks on whose backs America has thrived. The waitress in your local steak house...the lunch lady who has been there for 45 years and is now too old to start a new career.

You seem to be severely detached with reality.",1
UgyxCem7dgGg1nkHTW14AaABAg.9_5Q0NTk4ux9_FJhnKuOks,"@Jimmy Reese I have no idea what you are talking about...both of my comments are still posted, and your one question about lunch ladies is still present as well. It's not like we've had a major long term dialogue here...To clarify my response: I did wait tables because I wanted the work first...but then I did it for many years for the love of service to people; AND I WAS VERY GOOD AT IT, so my wage was very good; worthy of  the work. I only quit because food service became too high tech, and the customer suffered as I had to battle with a computer. I do know lunch ladies who stay in the position for the love of the work. I'm not saying they can't better themselves, but it's the personality of the ""service worker"" that keeps them planted in those arenas. Then there's market issues...the market can only handle just so many ""influencers"" or ""etsy shops"" or ""content creators""...I've stopped watching many content creators because they are mundane and meaningless...they are building houses, running around the world on some patreons dime, or camping in impossible conditions for the average person. They have no depth or substance to interest me. Some have interesting things to say, but they sit and preach at me...those types number in the millions I think...most of them repeating the same topics as 1000s of others. All of them expecting to do what ""Mr. Beast"" does...who really does nothing but entertain. Absolutely no depth, meaning or substance to his videos. Yet his views are in the millions, and he's a billionaire (last I looked at his income/worth stats) at 30 some years of age. I guess that kind of reflects the mentality of the times...right? People seek out change if they are discontent...you assume discontent just because these people work blue collar, service, or homemaking positions...but they aren't necessarily discontented with their lot in life. The Left and Democrats make those assumptions as well...and then preach that we need to ""improve"" or simply buy an electric vehicle, or just get a better job, or just learn to code....I WOULD BE TERRIBLY UPSET IF I WAS MADE TO SIT AND DO CODE ALL DAY...DEPRESSION WOULD BE NATURAL STATE; REGARDLESS OF THE WAGE. I don't know if you are passionate about your work...but you seem to work for the money first and foremost, regardless of joy, peace, mental and emotional fulfillment or pursuing perfection in a field you love. So be it. That's your choice...But do not simply make the assumption that everyone can or wants that as ""THEIR"" end result.",0
UgyxCem7dgGg1nkHTW14AaABAg.9_5Q0NTk4ux9_FLMtTT6b7,"@B. D. Walters Let me ask you this, why are so many minimum wage workers wanting more money if they do it for the joy of it?  If it's so much fun being a mcdonalds cashier, why does she deserve more money?  Like I said, you do not have a fair grasp on reality and you're living in some make believe alternate universe.

UgykO2A4WyXD46q15b54AaABAg.9_ARJW2-6Kj9_DkrNyn_Sb,"The destruction of the Soviet Union and breaking it into separate countries was illegal. On December 8, 1991, governors of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus met in a cabin in a forest in the middle of the night and signed a paper - The Belovezh Accords - stating that the Soviet Union did not exist anymore. What they did then was illegal. The next morning, they called Gorbachev and told him about the paper they signed. By law, Gorbachev had to arrest them for treason. Instead, Gorbachev joined their coup. Gorbachev immediately called the White House and reported, ""It's done."" Then, Gorbachev showed up on TV and said to people, ""Good morning, the Soviet Union does not exist anymore. Goodbye."" After that, Gorbachev permanently leaved the Soviet Union and moved to Germany, where he received a title of the Best German Ever, along with multi-million-dollar mansion located in one of German resorts. 
The referendum on the preservation of the USSR, the only referendum conducted across the whole Soviet Union in the history of the USSR, was held on March 17, 1991. It addressed the preservation of the USSR as a renewed federation of equal sovereign states and republics of the former USSR. Of the 185.6 million (80%) citizens of the USSR who had the right to vote, 148.5 million (79.5%) took part in the referendum. Of those people, 113.5 million (76.43%) voted in favor of preserving the Soviet Union, supporting the preservation of a renewed USSR. That was the only one truly democratic event in the 20th century, when the whole nation was deciding the fate of its country via direct voting. What Gorbachev and Yeltsin did then - i.e., breaking the Soviet Union into separate countries - was unconstitutional and anti-democratic. Their actions went directly against the will of the People and against the Law. 

By the time that happened in the Soviet Union, Gorbachev's people sabotaged and destroyed most of supply chains in the country, started hyperinflation, released massive numbers of criminals from prisons and to the streets of cities. Regular people had so much hardship that they had no means to fight the The Belovezh Accords coup.

What would you say if the US citizens voted to keep the US as one country, and then they would wake up in the morning and the US President would tell them from a TV screen that the US did not exist anymore because the Governors of Texas, Florida and California met at night in a forest, next to the border with Mexico, and signed a paper saying that the US ends? 

Gorbachev betrayed his people, served the interests of Germany. And for that, Germany gave Gorbachev a German citizenship, a title of the Best German Ever and a multi-million-euro mansion in one of German resorts.",0

Then I changed it to thumbs down when it got political and turned into an inaccurate depiction of Trump vs. Biden -- especially Biden, who has been tougher on Putin than Trump ever was.  Trump never called Putin a war criminal nor said he has to go or ""he cannot remain in power"".   What Trump DID do was try to blackmail Ukraine by withholding needed weapons in order to further Trump's political campaign. I do agree, however, that we should allow (and encourage) Poland to send its Migs to Ukraine, and also send Ukraine anything and everything else it needs to push Russia out.",0

UgyX3abFwISpwvPZ2iN4AaABAg.9ZYZVqO9ZQ29ZdXvrU7F7T,"What you are saying about the cause of pump prices is incorrect. The oil companies actually absolutely need to increase production to lower costs. However, they put out a  statement 2 weeks ago stating that they absolutely will NOT increase production, even now. AND, for those that keep whining about the ""Keystone Pipeline,"" let's  clear that up.The Keystone Pipeline (which runs fuel into the U.S.) is still running.The Keystone XL , which went through multiple tribal lands, and was specifically for oil production waste, and oil  specified by Canada to be shipped overseas, is the one which was shut down.It doesn't  even belong to the U.S.I don't care what Trump SAID. I KNOW what he did.  And what he did was buy out all the oil to keep pump prices artificially low, and when that move started ""tanking"" the oil companies, he bailed them out with billion$ and they made a huge profit on the bailouts.It was going to comeback to bite us some time or other because  basically he was doing the equivalent of racking up charges on a credit card. It might have taken 8 years if he kept pushing it ( but that bill would have kept growing in size).Either way, the next president would be stuck with a bill Trump basically  racked up, and then be blamed for record inflation. And believe me, that ""record inflation"" would have been exponentially worse after 8 years.All, of course, was Trump's plan. Which is exactly why he (and most economists) were able to ""predict"" it. He's  no prophet.He's  messed up his own businesses  enough to know how to do it to leave other people holding the bag.I'm  not surprised at his maneuvers. It is exactly how he runs his businesses and exactly why he has declared bankruptcy 10x in 30 years.It doesn't  work that way in a government  economy however. It ends up being WE who pay for it.Putin's  disgusting moves have just exasperated a problem that Trump had already set in motion.",0

FL was nice but there are too many folks moving there and it is super crowded and highly competitive. I feel like there is too much (group think) going on and everybody is moving to FL, Texas, Arizona etc. especially all the baby boomers I assume so their 401k or pensions aren't taxed and the warm weather. As a younger person there is a lot of opportunity in the Midwest right now if you are skilled and have good work ethic you can negotiate great pay right now, employers are offering amazing pay to anyone that can fog a mirror, you literally have to try hard to be unemployed here at the moment. It pains me that so many young people complain about all the good manufacturing jobs disappearing yet those jobs that are still here that require no college degree and pay great are having a hard time filling open positions. I like the brutal cold here too because huge equity firms like BlackRock aren't gobbling up the residential housing for vacation rentals for tourists and price speculation and the elderly don't like the cold and move to warmer places to retire so there is better supply & demand (cost of living) for the local community that is actually working where the jobs are, nothing against older Americans but in FL there are so many retired people that can live anywhere and aren't bound by their career/job and they drive housing/rent up to unaffordable levels and younger people with little to no assets/cash can afford to live where they need to work and can't reduce transportation cost because the public transit is terrible so you need a car whereas older retirees do not need vehicles necessarily (this is my assumption/theory on why it has become less desirable there, depending on who you ask of course). Too your point, I love the farms, trees, and nature here and I hope where I relocated doesn't grow very fast it is perfect right now calm not densely populated but good blue color jobs and regular working-class Americans, no high rolling white collars just ""well off"" local small business owners.",0

Straw Man

A straw man (sometimes written as strawman) is a form of argument and an informal fallacy of having the impression of refuting an argument, whereas the real subject of the argument was not addressed or refuted, but instead replaced with a false one. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be ""attacking a straw man"".

The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the opponent's proposition. Straw man arguments have been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly regarding highly charged emotional subjects.",0
