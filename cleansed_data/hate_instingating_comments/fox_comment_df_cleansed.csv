Either you are deliberately spreading this fake information either it is interpreted deliberately wrong. Ukraine is considered to be a sovereign country.  But in Ukraine majority of people are of Russian nationality  and only  minority are "" true"" non- Russian nationality. Even 150 years ago the nationality ""ukrainian"" did not exist officially.  Americans do not know the history  of Ukraine, otherwise they would find out that Ukraine as a state or republic was created by Lenin after Russian Revolution.  If you want to check it even without reading any book of History of Ukraine just Google any OLD map of Russian Empire ( not made in 2000 by Ukrainian nationalists) but real old  before revolution 2017 and find if Ukraine ever existed before on the map of Russian Empire.  So Putin was saying that we ( the Russians)  are one nation with Ukrainians meaning that today's  Ukrainians are "" made"" of yesterday's russians. This is historical truth. More to it , modern Ukraine, when formed by Lenin, consisted  mostly of pure Russian territories and people, and then areas of Donbas  were  added even  later and Crimea was added by Chruschov much later,( somewere between 1950 and 1960 ) during USSR.    So Putin always sad that we are one root and one nation and without each other its difficult for us to prosper and protect ourselves, so we should always stay together.  This is what Putin was  saying many times and meaning that we are like one family. And look how it is twisted and deliberately presented here to make Americans think that Putin does not recognize Ukraine as sovereign country and wants to re- create USSR. This is such a lie.",1.0,0

The Western nations must understand that India is the largest democracy in the world and it also has its geopolitical issues. Russia is a time tested ally of India, while the West supports India on issues with China but it is not on board with India in many issues. Russia is a key ally and also a supportive mediator. India recently bought 3 Million barrels of Russian Oil at a 30 percent discount price. It should be noted that Russian Energy is not sanctioned , hence it is a move which largely represents our current situation of walking a tightrope and focusing on national interests first and to appeal for diplomatic solutions.",0.2857142857142857,0

Of the students in the physics department at the time, a third were Americans of European descent, a third were Chinese (from Taiwan) and a third were Indian. It was a very international place. It was just outside of Washington, DC. where I was born. India does a lot more business with the US and the EU than it does with Russia. They need to break the defense relationship. It is not in their interest, and the Soviet equipment is inferior. In fact, they pulled out of an agreement to help develop and fund Russia's 5th generation fighter, which basically put the program on hold. They also recently bought French fighters. The Soviet/Russian planes they have did not do well against US planes supplied to Pakistan (F16s vs Migs). When will they realize their mistake? You really cannot be non-aligned in this world.

If someone in Russia talks about overthrowing the government, he will not even have time to finish the phrase before he is taken to a famous place. Everything is taken into account and counter-measures are provided. Nothing depends on the people. Any flash is immediately suppressed.

Where in the world have you seen freedom of speech? conditional in the US. It is clear that each word must be argued. ‚ÄúIf you criticize, then offer‚Äù - I fully support this train of thought. Everyone loves to use phrases with and without a reason. It's all in the wording. If the criticism is justified, then it must be listened to. But what if you are not allowed to open your mouth at all? Even in fact, and even if you turn out to be right?

There are countries that have vetoed talk of administration and politics. So do not demand too much and even more so do not expect from countries in which their own orders have been laid down historically for a long time.

You know, there was once an experiment with fleas. The fleas were covered with a glass lid. Some time later, the cover was removed, and yet the fleas could not overcome the height beyond which the distance where the cover was located would end. It is the same with the societies of all countries. Only the height of the cover is different everywhere.
